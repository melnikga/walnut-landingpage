    title: 'Deep Dive into Starknet Transaction Call Trace', 
    excerpt:'On Starknet, transactions represent the execution of programs written in the Cairo programming language. Each transaction (or program execution) is identified by a unique transaction hash, making it traceable and distinguishable. For instance, running the same program twenty times will result in twenty unique transactions, each with its own transaction hash. Like any program execution, the behavior of these transactions can be analyzed through a Call Trace, a detailed log that captures the functions invoked, the arguments passed, the outputs returned, and more.',
