                    <a href="https://cairovm.codes/">cairovm.codes</a> is a
                    powerful web application that serves both educational and
                    debugging purposes, helping users run and explore Cairo
                    programs while gaining a deeper understanding of their inner
                    workings. It is especially useful for those learning Cairo,
                    but it also functions as a capable debugger. The tool
                    presents detailed information about the CairoVM execution
                    and memory, while providing mappings from the execution
                    trace to CASM, Sierra, and Cairo.

                    üí° cairovm.codes has now been officially recognized by
                    Starkware. The Cairo team has integrated cairovm.codes into
                    the official Cairo website, which you can visit at{" "}

                  <p>
                    The app is divided into two main sections, providing a
                    seamless way to debug Cairo programs using cairovm.codes:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Code Editor (Left Panel):</strong> Here, you can
                      write arbitrary Cairo code. This allows users to quickly
                      test their programs, making cairovm.codes a valuable tool
                      for both learning and debugging Cairo programs.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Execution Details (Right Panel):</strong> After
                      running the code, this panel displays detailed information
                      about the CairoVM execution, enabling users to explore the
                      program counter (PC), allocation pointer (AP), frame
                      pointer (FP), registers, as well as the memory and
                      function call stack.
                    </li>
                  </ul>

                  <p>
                    The app also offers a three-column mode, for users
                    interested in seeing Sierra alongside Cairo and CASM. By
                    using the ‚ÄúNext‚Äù and ‚ÄúPrevious‚Äù buttons, developers can
                    rerun the program execution, analyzing how registers,
                    memory, or the function call stack change over time. With
                    each step, cairovm.codes highlights the corresponding Cairo,
                    CASM, and Sierra code, visually showing which line of code
                    is being executed.
