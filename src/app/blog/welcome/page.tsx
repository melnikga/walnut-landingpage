                    We are excited to launch this blog as a platform for sharing
                    our experiences, challenges, and advancements in developing
                    tools for blockchain engineers, with a specific focus on
                    Starknet. Our goal is to foster insightful discussions and
                    actively engage with community feedback.
                  </p>
                  <p>Our mission is clear:</p>
                  <blockquote>
                    <p>
                      We aim to empower every Starknet developer to achieve
                      more.
                    </p>

                  <p>
                    Our first product, the Walnut Debugger, is a visual,
                    step-by-step debugger designed for Starknet developers who
                    work with Cairo. Currently in its closed Beta stage, we
                    anticipate launching in Q1 2024. The Walnut Debugger fills a
                    critical gap by being the first debugger built for Cairo. If
                    you&apos;re interested in early access, we&apos;d love to
                    hear from you.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While we recognize that a debugger alone is not enough to
                    fulfill our mission for the rapidly expanding Starknet
                    developer community, we see it as a crucial step. With this
                    understanding, let&apos;s delve into other areas and tools
                    we at Walnut are developing, each tailored to address
                    specific challenges Starknet developers face.

                      <p>
                        <strong>Storage diff visualization.</strong> Developers
                        need better visibility into smart contract storage and
                        how transactions affect it. This tool is particularly
                        useful for optimizing smart contract memory. On
                        Starknet, transaction costs are mostly impacted by
                        storage, therefore the ability to optimize storage is
                        vital.

                        <strong>Gas profiling.</strong> Starknet&apos;s
                        execution may be generally cheap, but visibility into
                        gas consumption is still necessary. Poorly written
                        contracts can consume excessive gas, even on Starknet.
                        Gas profilers offer monitoring capabilities and assist
                        in improving the gas footprint.

                        <strong>Web 3 actions</strong> enable developers to
                        write custom code that executes in response to
                        predefined on-chain events on Starknet. For instance, a
                        developer could set up a Telegram notification when a
                        loan health factor drops below a certain percentage.

                        Simulations allow developers to test transactions and
                        see outcomes without the need to send them on-chain and
                        pay for gas. Monitoring tools based on these simulations
                        provide dApp developers with insights into potential
                        user issues, reducing the need for direct user support
                        interaction.

                        <strong>Shared devnets</strong> provide Starknet
                        developer teams with a collaborative environment for
                        writing smart contracts and dApps. Unlike public
                        testnets, shared devnets offer privacy for projects and
                        a gas-free environment.

                    Among the top 20 ecosystems (measured by full-time

                    has increased by an incredible 622% in the last two years.
                    This growth is much higher than Osmosis at 194% and Arbitrum
